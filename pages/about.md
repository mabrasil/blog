Hello, I’m *Matheus Albuquerque* - or *Matheus Brasil*, if you prefer. I'm a front-end developer and designer who lives in [Fortaleza, CE](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza). 

I started playing with programming at the age of 11 - not actually much ago - and since then I’ve played with a considerable amount of languages, from mainstream ones like Java, C#, Python and JavaScript (<3), passing by <strike>lovable</strike> functional ones like Haskell, Rust and Clojure to really <strike>weird</strike> esoteric ones like Brainfuck.

As you may know I consider myself a *web alchemist* who's always trying new technologies and specially playing with cool stuff. My passions include the design and implementation of full stack projects, open source stuff, indie, electronic & rock music, and also SPFC (<3). <strike>In my freetime</strike> I also study Informatics at Instituto Federal do Ceará.
